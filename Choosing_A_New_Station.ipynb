Introduction\n\nThe public transportation system in the city of Atlanta is Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA).\nDue to the influx of population into Atlanta and to curb the traffic congestion in the city, MARTA has decided to expand its subway system to service the areas in Fulton county that do not already have any MARTA lines running through them. In other words, it wants to build a new line that connects with one of the existing lines. Due to its limited budget, however, MARTA can only build three new stations during the first phase of the expansion project.\n\n\nThe challenge is to pick three neighborhoods within a reasonable proximity to each other to create a new subway line. To ensure maximum serviceability, MARTA wants to make sure that the neighborhoods already have high foot traffic."

Data\n\nThe data will be retrieved from multiple sources to analyze the foot traffic of each neighborhood in Fulton county. \n\nFirst, a GeoJSON file is needed to map the neighborhoods.\nA GeoJSON file from \"Zillows - US Neighborhoods\" from Opendatasoft database. The file is too large, so it will be filtered with Georgia state and Fulton county before downloading.\n[opendatasoft link]\nhttps://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/zillow-neighborhoods%40public/export/?refine.state=GA&refine.county=Fulton&location=13,33.79477,-84.35071&basemap=jawg.sunny&dataChart=eyJxdWVyaWVzIjpbeyJjb25maWciOnsiZGF0YXNldCI6InppbGxvdy1uZWlnaGJvcmhvb2RzQHB1YmxpYyIsIm9wdGlvbnMiOnsibG9jYXRpb24iOiIxMiwzMy43NTQzMiwtODQuNDU3OTEiLCJiYXNlbWFwIjoiamF3Zy5zdW5ueSJ9fSwiY2hhcnRzIjpbeyJhbGlnbk1vbnRoIjp0cnVlLCJ0eXBlIjoiY29sdW1uIiwiZnVuYyI6IkNPVU5UIiwic2NpZW50aWZpY0Rpc3BsYXkiOnRydWUsImNvbG9yIjoiIzE0MkU3QiJ9XSwieEF4aXMiOiJzdGF0ZSIsIm1heHBvaW50cyI6NTAsInNvcnQiOiIifV0sInRpbWVzY2FsZSI6IiIsImRpc3BsYXlMZWdlbmQiOnRydWUsImFsaWduTW9udGgiOnRydWV9\n\nSecond, populations of neighborhoods will be an excellent baseline indicator of foot traffic.\nThis data will be collected from Wikipedia. The table contains neighborhoods that may not be in the GeoJSON file, and those will be disregarded for sake of simplicity.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Atlanta_neighborhoods_by_population\n\nThird, each neighborhood's foot traffic will also be measured by the economic activity in the neighborhood.\nHaving a higher population density does not guarantee a higher use of subway systems if the area is residential.\nFor simplicity, number of restaurants will be used as a metric for economic activity.\nThe restaurant data will be collected from Foursquare.\n\nThese data will be used to generate choropleth maps that show neighborhoods with a custom foot traffic index to derive the best possible locations for new MARTA stations."
